## Imperfect Data

- The data I'm using can be found here [source]https://data.seattle.gov/Community/Landmarks/2mcp-vtwb
- The data is on Landmarks in Seattle from the City of Seattle's public data

### Questions posed and answered in my Jupyter Notebook
- What percentage of the landmarks have websites?
- How many schools are considered Landmarks?
- How evenly dispersed are the landmarked schools?
- How close are the landmarked libraries to the landmarked schools?
- How many landmarks are around the Space Needle?
